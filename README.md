# üêæ Animal Kingdom Classification

This **Neural Networks & Deep Learning** project classifies animal species from images using state-of-the-art architectures.  
The system processes images through preprocessing and augmentation before feeding them into models such as **Vision Transformer**, **MobileNet**, **CNN**, and **ResNet**.  
The goal is to achieve high classification accuracy and robust performance across diverse animal categories.
